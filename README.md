# GoBGP Exporter

Export GoBGP data to Prometheus.

To run it:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src
mkdir -p github.com/ovnworks
cd github.com/ovnworks
git clone https://github.com/ovnworks/gobgp_exporter.git
cd gobgp_exporter
make
make qtest
```

## Flags

```bash
./gobgp_exporter --help
```

* __`gobgp.address`:__ Address (host and port) of the GoBGP instance we should
    connect to. This could be a local GoBGP server (`127.0.0.0:50051`, for
    instance), or the address of a remote GoBGP server.
* __`gobgp.timeout`:__ Timeout on gRPC requests to GoBGP.
* __`gobgp.poll-interval`:__ The minimum interval (in seconds) between collections from GoBGP server. (default: 15 seconds)
* __`gobgp.peers`:__ The file containing the mapping between `router_id` and the name (e.g. `hostname`) of a remote peer.
* __`version`:__ Show application version.
* __`web.listen-address`:__ Address to listen on for web interface and telemetry.
* __`web.telemetry-path`:__ Path under which to expose metrics.

## Outstanding Issues

The following is a list of issues related to GoBGP package itself:
- `gobgp_peer_session_state` reports `0`, although a router maybe in `established` (`5`) state.
  The metric is being derived from `PeerState.SessionState`
